      <font color="red" size="5"> President al-Sisi’s government has not eased its nationwide repression
        that caused one of Egypt’s worst human rights crises in many decades.
        Whitewashing efforts meant little beyond cosmetic changes. Authorities
        released hundreds of detainees but arrested much more, adding to the
        thousands of critics, including journalists, peaceful activists, and human
        rights defenders, who remain imprisoned. Civil society key members face
        intimidation, travel bans, and assets freeze. Authorities harass and
        detain relatives of dissidents abroad and use vague “morality” charges to
        prosecute LGBT people, female social media influencers, and survivors of
        sexual violence. Grave crimes, including torture and enforced
        disappearances , are committed with impunity.</font>
