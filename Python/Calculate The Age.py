# calculate the age.....

str_age = input("How Old Are You ? \n")
year = 2024 
age = int(str_age)
your_age =2024 - age 
print("You Were Born In The Year " +str(your_age) )

# ************************************************

# another way to solve this code 

# int_age = int (input("How Old Are You ? \n"))   # int 
# print(f"You Were Born In {2024 - int_age}")
